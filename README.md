# PDF Finder
This is a tool I wrote for studying/making open book exams that segments
your study material and allows you to search over all your lectures at once
using an elastic search algorithm. If you want to use this yourself you should
modify the arrays NAMES and AMTS in App.js as the browser isn't allowed to access your file
storage and query what files you have.

Code is somewhat messy as it was written in a hurry preparing for my exams,
might clean it up at some point but don't count on it.

Should look similar to this: ![preview](https://i.imgur.com/SIByZTM.png)
